{% hint style="info" %}
All files are being uploaded in `original` style. you can add other styles, but the original file is being uploaded as original format.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Larupload stores additional information such as `name`, `size`, `format` and... in database. if you create attachment in `HEAVY` mode, Larupload will create a column for each of this information. it's recommended when you want to search/order data by their information. but in `LIGHT` mode, all this information will store in a json column.
