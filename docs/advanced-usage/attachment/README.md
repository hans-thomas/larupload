# Attachment

Attachments are entities that are attached to specific models in your application, and allow you to easily upload, store, and retrieve files related to those models.

The attachment is stored in the file system and its metadata is saved to the database for quick retrieval and management. The package provides a powerful set of configuration options to customize the attachment management process to fit the specific needs of the application.

In this article, we provide detailed information on how to customize Larupload's attachment entities for each model.&#x20;
