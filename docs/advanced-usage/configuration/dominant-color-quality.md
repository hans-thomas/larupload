# Dominant Color Quality

You can set quality to adjust the calculation accuracy of the dominant color. 1 is the highest quality settings, 10 is the default. But be aware that there is a trade-off between quality and speed/memory consumption! If the quality settings are too high (close to 1) relative to the image size (pixel counts), it may **exceed the memory limit** set in the PHP configuration (and computation will be slow).
