# Mode

Larupload offers two modes for storing uploaded file information: `HEAVY` mode and `LIGHT` mode.&#x20;

`HEAVY` mode stores all file details in their own columns, while `LIGHT` mode stores additional information in a `meta` column as JSON-encoded data.

&#x20;It's important to choose the appropriate mode for the type of table being used.
